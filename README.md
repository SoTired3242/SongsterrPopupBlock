# SongsterrPopupBlock
Some code that will remove the popup that Songsterr (the guitar learning website) shows whenever you try to play along with original audio. Only works for 1920 by 1080 monitors and is prone to screen detection bugs and Songsterr updates. Message me on Discord at s0tired. for any bug fixes or updates (make sure you include the period!).
